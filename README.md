# Simple Docs (minimal Google Docs-like editor)

Open simple-docs/index.html in your browser for a clean, lightweight editor that feels like paper.

## Quickstart

- Open simple-docs/index.html. No build step or server.

## Features

- Clean, distraction-free canvas (contenteditable).
- Toolbar: Undo/Redo, Headings (H1–H3), Bold/Italic/Underline, Bullets/Numbers, Block Quote, Links, Clear Formatting.
- Title field and autosave to localStorage.
- Export to .html and .md.

## Notes

- This is a minimal, client-only scaffold intended to feel like paper: no pages or margins, just a fluid canvas.
- To keep pushes clean, do not commit 
ode_modules/ or build outputs. The .gitignore already excludes those.
